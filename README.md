If you have a NVIDIA GPU, it is best to enable CUDA for TensorFlow. Here is a link to a tutorial which we follow to enable CUDA within our GPU: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu

The images used in the project are obtain from google image search.

In order to save time for Prof. Pham, we have saved the console output into HTML files.
